## Description
This project visualizes the Fibonacci sequence using the manim library. The visualization includes drawing squares whose side lengths correspond to Fibonacci numbers and adding spiral arcs to connect these squares, creating a Fibonacci spiral.

## Usage
To run the visualization, you need to have the manim library installed. You can install it using pip:
```sh
pip install manim
```

Then, you can run the script using the following command:
```sh
manim -pqm Fibonacci.py FibonacciSpiral
```
-m for medium quality, -l for low and -h for high resolution.
